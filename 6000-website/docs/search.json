    "text": "The application of Machine Learning (ML) in this project has provided insight into the relationship between fan sentiment on Reddit and actual match and player data from Euro 2024 and Copa America 2024. Our goal was to predict match outcomes, match states, and most recent match events using sentiment analysis and structured match data. By leveraging Spark ML, we successfully developed binary classification models that demonstrated strong predictive performance.\nOne of the most impactful accomplishments of this analysis was the ability to predict match outcomes with a high degree of accuracy, based on both sentiment metrics from subreddit activity and real-time match data. This achievement underscores the potential for integrating NLP-driven insights with structured sports analytics to create predictive tools for event forecasting.\nThe models not only showcased excellent performance but also revealed actionable insights, such as the influence of fan sentiment on match predictions and how specific player or team statistics correlate with game dynamics. These findings provide a framework for developing scalable and efficient predictive systems for sports analytics, empowering stakeholders to enhance fan engagement, optimize team strategies, and identify potential opportunities for sponsorships or partnerships."

    "text": "In this project, we applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to conduct sentiment analysis on the Reddit data including comments on 2024 UEFA Euro and Copa América. Our primary accomplishments include proving a correlation between comment sentiment and real-world performance, as well as showing how the events of a match can impact predictiveness. These results are significant because we can conclude that there is value in analyzing text for outcome prediction, while also highlighting the need for more granular analysis to see if we can extract the context surrounding a comment. These insights directly support our goal of linking our Reddit data to match and players metrics."

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

These users contributed 4,422 comments with an average score of 14, indicating a generally favorable reception to their posts. They also gave a moderate number of controversial submissions (238), with an average controversiality of 0.05. In contrast, users from Netherlands submitted 872 comments with an average score of 8, reflecting a lower positive engagement. However, they exhibit a high average controversiality of 0.07, demonstrating a tendency toward more polarizing content. In Spain, users contributed 837 comments with the highest average score of 22, suggesting their posts received a more favorable reception. Furthermore, their average controversiality of 0.04 is relatively low, showing that their content is less divisive. France has the lowest engagement, with only 544 comments and an average score of 11. Their controversial count (8) and average controversiality (0.01) are the lowest across all groups. This data suggests that user origin may influence both the volume of engagement and the tone of interactions on the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.2.4\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Author Origin\n      Comment Count\n      Average Score\n      Controversial Count\n      Average Controversiality\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit users from Argentina demonstrated the highest participation in the Copa América discussions within the soccer subreddit, contributing 1,415 comments with an average score of 15. This suggests their posts were generally well-received, although their controversial submissions (111) and average controversiality of 0.08 highlight some divisive topics. Canadian users followed closely with 1,245 comments, but their average score of 8 indicates a relatively lower level of positive engagement. With 64 controversial submissions and an average controversiality of 0.05, their discussions were moderately contentious. Colombian users contributed 773 comments, matching Argentina’s average score of 15, suggesting similar favorability in their contributions. However, their low controversial count (23) and average controversiality of 0.03 reveal less divisive content overall. Finally, Uruguayan users, despite having the fewest comments (139), achieved the highest average score of 30, signaling highly impactful posts. However, their average controversiality of 0.12 and controversial count (17) suggest a more polarizing nature in their engagement. These insights illustrate varying levels of participation, sentiment, and divisiveness among fan bases in Copa América discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.2.4\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Author Origin\n      Comment Count\n      Average Score\n      Controversial Count\n      Average Controversiality\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUEFA Euro Match Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.2.4\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Date\n      Round\n      Score\n      Home\n      Away\n      Attendance\n      Home Score\n      Away Score\n      Winning Team\n      Losing Team\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopa América Match Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.2.4\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Date\n      Round\n      Score\n      Home\n      Away\n      Attendance\n      Home Score\n      Away Score\n      Winning Team\n      Losing Team\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTournament Results\nCopa america"

    "text": "3 Datasets\n\n3.1 Soccer Subreddit\nFirstly, in order to assess the prevalence of UEFA Euro 2024 and Copa América 2024 on Reddit, we can take a look at the total volume of comments over time on the widely-used soccer subreddit. Due to its heavy moderation and strict naming conventions for individual submissions, we concluded that submission volume would entail too much human intervention, thus making comment count a more representative metric to determine platform usage. The figure below illustrates that given our dataset that ranges from May 2023 to August 2024, the periods in which these tournaments coincided (denoted by the red dotted lines) resulted in a noticeable and sustained uptick in comment volume. The plot reflects a 7-day moving average of total daily comments on the subreddit in order to better capture traffic over the tournament period, rather than specific match days. This peak is also significant due to the fact that most major domestic leagues have their offseason during the summer, meaning that the volume increase came during a period of fewer matches across the world. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the coincidence of two major international tournaments directly led to increased traffic on the soccer subreddit.\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit users from England have the highest participation in the soccer subreddit. These users contributed 4,422 comments with an average score of 14, indicating a generally favorable reception to their posts. They also gave a moderate number of controversial submissions (238), with an average controversiality of 0.05. In contrast, users from Netherlands submitted 872 comments with an average score of 8, reflecting a lower positive engagement. However, they exhibit a high average controversiality of 0.07, demonstrating a tendency toward more polarizing content. In Spain, users contributed 837 comments with the highest average score of 22, suggesting their posts received a more favorable reception. Furthermore, their average controversiality of 0.04 is relatively low, showing that their content is less divisive. France has the lowest engagement, with only 544 comments and an average score of 11. Their controversial count (8) and average controversiality (0.01) are the lowest across all groups. This data suggests that user origin may influence both the volume of engagement and the tone of interactions on the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.2.4\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Author Origin\n      Comment Count\n      Average Score\n      Controversial Count\n      Average Controversiality\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit users from Argentina demonstrated the highest participation in the Copa América discussions within the soccer subreddit, contributing 1,415 comments with an average score of 15. This suggests their posts were generally well-received, although their controversial submissions (111) and average controversiality of 0.08 highlight some divisive topics. Canadian users followed closely with 1,245 comments, but their average score of 8 indicates a relatively lower level of positive engagement. With 64 controversial submissions and an average controversiality of 0.05, their discussions were moderately contentious. Colombian users contributed 773 comments, matching Argentina’s average score of 15, suggesting similar favorability in their contributions. However, their low controversial count (23) and average controversiality of 0.03 reveal less divisive content overall. Finally, Uruguayan users, despite having the fewest comments (139), achieved the highest average score of 30, signaling highly impactful posts. However, their average controversiality of 0.12 and controversial count (17) suggest a more polarizing nature in their engagement. These insights illustrate varying levels of participation, sentiment, and divisiveness among fan bases in Copa América discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.2.4\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Author Origin\n      Comment Count\n      Average Score\n      Controversial Count\n      Average Controversiality\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Country Subreddits\nIn addition to analyzing soccer-specific corners of Reddit, we also gathered data from each subreddit that corresponded to a country to make the knockout rounds of either tournament. Since many of these contained comments and submissions primarily in foreign languages, text analysis proved difficult, so one way to determine the volume of soccer discussion in these communities was to see whether r/soccer users were also active in country subreddits. By obtaining the proportions of comments in each subreddit that came from r/soccer users, we can see whether or not the time period of Euro 2024 and Copa América attracted soccer fans to discuss in country subreddits.\nOur findings were that for most country subreddits, the proportion decreased during the specified time period, and some countries had no presence of r/soccer users at all. The figure below illustrates this reality, and indicates to us that NLP and ML tasks might be more effective using communities in which we know the users are discussing soccer. England appears to be an exception to the rule, as a great proportion of r/england commenters are also r/soccer commenters, while also seeing an increase during the tournament season. However, it is otherwise apparent that international competition did not entice soccer to bring their traffic to country subreddits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 UEFA Euro Match Data\nThe match data was derived from FBRef and includes information about the Home Score, Away Score, and Attendance.\nIn the group stage, top teams such as Germany, Spain, and Netherlands asserted their dominance, with Germany securing a commanding 5–1 victory over Scotland and Spain achieving a 3–0 win against Croatia. Meanwhile, Switzerland, Slovakia, and Ukraine delivered significant upsets, with Switzerland defeating Hungary 3–1 and Ukraine overcoming Poland in a 2–1 result. The group stage also witnessed a number of closely contested draws, including goalless stalemates between Denmark and Serbia, and England and Slovenia, reflecting the tournament’s overall competitiveness.\nAs the tournament progressed into the Round of 16, the intensity heightened, with Spain continuing their strong form with a dominant 4–1 victory over Georgia, while France narrowly defeated Belgium 1–0. Several matches, such as the 0–0 draw between Portugal and Slovenia, underscored the high stakes of the knockout rounds, with Portugal advancing after a penalty shootout. In the quarter-finals, Spain edged past Germany 2–1, and Netherlands overcame Türkiye with a similar scoreline, further solidifying their positions as strong contenders. The quarter-final clash between Portugal and France was particularly memorable, as France triumphed 3–0 in a penalty shootout following a 0–0 draw after regular and extra time.\nThe semi-finals saw Spain overcome France 2–1, while England triumphed 2–1 over Netherlands, setting up a highly anticipated final between Spain and England. The final, held on July 14, 2024, concluded with Spain securing a 2–1 victory, capturing their second European Championship title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.2.4\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Date\n      Round\n      Score\n      Home\n      Away\n      Attendance\n      Home Score\n      Away Score\n      Winning Team\n      Losing Team\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.4 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Copa América Match Data\nThe match data was derived from FBRef and includes information about the Home Score, Away Score, and Attendance.\nThe group stage began with a dominant 2-0 win for Argentina over Canada, while Venezuela claimed a 2-1 victory over Ecuador.

Spain, with 15 goals over 7 games and an xG of 1.69, has significantly outperformed its xG, suggesting effective finishing and possibly a higher-than-expected conversion rate of scoring opportunities. Similarly, Germany’s performance of 10 goals in 4 games, paired with an xG of 2.07, highlights their ability to capitalize on attacking chances and exceed their expected output. These teams demonstrate efficiency in front of goal, possibly indicating superior tactical execution or individual player quality that contributes to their higher-than-expected goal tally.\nConversely, other teams in the dataset, such as Scotland and Serbia, have underperformed relative to their xG values. Scotland scored only 2 goals in 3 games despite an xG of 0.23, which suggests a significant underachievement, possibly due to poor finishing or lack of quality chances created. Serbia, with just 1 goal in 3 games and an xG of 0.58, similarly appears to have struggled to convert opportunities into actual goals. This discrepancy between actual and expected performance underscores the importance of not just creating scoring chances but also the ability to finish those chances effectively. These findings point to areas where teams may need to focus on improving their finishing, while the teams outperforming their xG might benefit from further tactical refinement to sustain their high output over a longer period.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n4.2 UEFA Euro Attendance\nAttendance trends during the 2024 UEFA Euro Championship indicate a clear correlation between match significance and crowd size. High-profile games, particularly semi-finals and the final, consistently attracted larger audiences, with venues such as the Allianz Arena and Olympiastadion Berlin seeing attendance figures of over 60,000 spectators. This trend aligns with the high demand for tickets to major fixtures, highlighting the direct impact of match importance on fan turnout.\nVenue selection also played a critical role in attendance patterns, with certain stadiums like Signal Iduna Park and Veltins-Arena regularly hosting large crowds. Notably, prime time match scheduling, particularly in the evening, contributed to higher attendance rates, as seen in fixtures like Spain vs. Italy at Veltins-Arena. These findings underscore the interplay between venue capacity, match timing, and the overall significance of the fixture in determining fan attendance.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n4.3 Copa América Goals\nThe data reveals notable differences in offensive performance across teams, with Argentina leading the tournament in total goals, scoring 9 goals in 6 games. Argentina’s average expected goals (xG) of 2.26 per match suggests they had strong offensive efficiency relative to their opportunities. In contrast, teams like Chile and Peru, who did not score any goals, had lower xG values, indicating struggles to convert chances into goals.\nBrazil, Colombia, and Uruguay were also high scorers, with 5, 12, and 11 goals respectively, supported by solid xG values—Brazil (1.6), Colombia (1.58), and Uruguay (1.54)—indicating consistent offensive production throughout the tournament. On the other hand, countries like Costa Rica, Jamaica, and Panama had relatively lower xG values, highlighting their more defensive or less effective attacking performances. The discrepancy between total goals and xG values further illustrates how teams like Mexico, with 1 goal from 3 games and an xG of 1.9, may have underperformed in terms of finishing opportunities.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n4.4 Copa América Attendance\nThe 2024 Copa América matches took place at a variety of prominent venues across the United States, with stadiums such as AT&T Stadium, Allegiant Stadium, and Hard Rock Stadium hosting some of the key games. These venues provided ample seating, accommodating large crowds ranging from 15,625 at Children’s Mercy Park to over 70,000 at Levi’s Stadium and Bank of America Stadium. This wide range of attendance numbers reflects the varying levels of interest in different matches, with high-stakes games, like Argentina vs. Colombia in the final, attracting larger crowds compared to group-stage encounters featuring less popular teams. The largest attendance of 81,106 was recorded at MetLife Stadium during a group-stage match between Argentina and Chile, highlighting the popularity of high-profile matchups.\nThe attendance figures show a clear correlation between match importance and crowd size. For example, the final between Argentina and Colombia at Hard Rock Stadium drew 65,300 spectators, while the semi-finals and quarter-finals also saw significant turnout, with venues like NRG Stadium and Allegiant Stadium hosting around 50,000 to 70,000 fans. On the other hand, less anticipated matchups, such as Costa Rica vs. Paraguay at Q2 Stadium, saw relatively smaller audiences, with only 12,765 attending. The overall venue variety and attendance patterns suggest that larger, more established stadiums drew bigger crowds for the most crucial matches, enhancing the tournament’s atmosphere and experience for both players and fans."

    "text": "5 Linking Reddit Data\nUsing data from FBREF and the soccer subreddit, comments were filtered based on whether they occurred during or immediately after a match in which the commenter’s flair aligned with a competing country. For example, if a commenter with an “England” user flair comments within four hours after the start time of an England match, that comment will be part of our final dataset. Considering this, we can then assess whether or not a commenter’s team won the match on which they were commenting, providing a framework to conduct future NLP and ML tasks on the predictive ability of comments on real-world performance.\nThe figure below shows the volume of comments for each match, partitioned by whether it was made by a fan of the winning or losing team. From this, we can make a few observations. Firstly, matches involving England appear to result in the greatest volume. This is unsurprising due to the lack of a language barrier, a large population, and a deep history of soccer fandom. On the Copa América side, matches involving Argentina result in heavy traffic, likely due to their involvement in the final and the stardom of Lionel Messi. Finally, the prevalence of Canada fans as the winner against Venezuela and the loser against Argentina is hard to miss, and is likely illustrative of Reddit being a site predominantly used by North Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to lining up comments with match times, we used the timing of submissions on the soccer subreddit to determine the time of events within a match, including goals and the end of a match. This allowed us to append to the comment dataset information on whether or not the commenter’s team was winning at the time of their comment, as well as the most recent event at the time of the comment. These are important because they provide context to what was happening at the time, and will allow for more granular analysis down the road.\nThe following three visuals show the volume of comments for whether or not the commenter’s team won, the status of the match at the time of commenting, and the most recent event at the time of commenting. The main takeaway from this is that we do see significantly more comments when the user’s team is experiencing positive results than negative."

    "text": "2 Analysis Report\n\n2.1 Introduction\nTo discover connections between Reddit data and real metrics, we used John Snow Labs to extract and analyze sentiment and emotion from the soccer subreddit. Data was filtered to specifically capture self-assigned user flairs and determine when fans were commenting during their teams’ matches. Our analysis focused specifically on the national teams that advanced to the knockout rounds of major international tournaments, providing a meaningful context to study fan reactions during high-stakes matches.\nOur primary goal was to analyze user-generated content in the most prominent soccer-related subreddit to classify sentiment as positive or negative and evaluate whether users were rooting for winning or losing teams. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we quantified sentiment by generating positivity scores and identified patterns in fan behavior across different nations and competitions. We also used NLP techniques to assess differences in player sentiment vs performance, using xG differential as a proxy for performance. This is not the perfect metric for performance, but since we were not able to find a dataset containing match ratings during the Euro Tournament, this was substituted as a performance metric.\nBy analyzing comments, we explored the emotional nuances of fan reactions to match results, player performances, and tournament outcomes. This data-driven approach allowed us to assess how fan sentiment aligns with actual performance metrics. This revealed interesting trends such as:\n\nHigher positivity scores in national subreddits following a team’s victory\nPeaks in engagement during critical tournament phases, such as semi-finals and finals\nVariability in NLP performance based on the results of a match\nSentiment regarding players did not seem to match up with their performance in terms of xG differential\n\nThis analysis provides a unique lens to understand the interplay between online fan behavior and real-world events, helping to uncover connections between digital expressions and national pride.\n\n\n2.2 Data Exploration\nDue to the highly unpredictable nature of Reddit comments, preprocessing is a vital step for obtaining meaningful results from Natural Language Processing. The first step of this entailed setting all letters to lower case so that capitalized words are not considered distinct from their lowercase counterparts. We then used a regular expression to remove all unusual characters such as numbers, punctuation, and emojis. Additionally, superfluous whitespace was removed and words were split and re-joined. Finally, all stopwords were removed to eliminate consideration of words that do not contribute to the meaning of a comment.\nAfter executing these tasks, we can explore the data and identify discrepancies between comments from commenter’s whose team won and those whose team lost. The wordclouds below provide a sample of the most common words from each category. There aren’t many surprises from this visualization. The usual suspects of soccer-related terms, player and country names, and vulgarity are all present in both wordclouds. At first glance, there isn’t much to detect that would suggest that winning fans behave too differently from their counterparts. Thus, NLP tasks will attempt to find what the human eye cannot.\nWe also generated a word cloud looking at which players were mentioned the most during this portion of the tournament. No surprise, the players who were most mentioned during this portion of the Euros were spanish and english players, and since these teams ended up in the final, this makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Analytical Approach\nThe NLP methodology of choice is a pre-trained sentiment analysis model in PySpark called sentimentdl_use_twitter. This will produce a binary output of positive or negative to portray the sentiment of each comment. These results will then be used to try to predict wins and losses, where we will hypothesize that positive-sentiment comments correlate with the commenter’s team winning.\n\n\n2.4 Results and Visualizations\nAfter attaching a sentiment to each comment, positivity ratios were then calculated based on groupings from other columns. The first question to explore was whether positive sentiment correlates with a team winning. The figure below shows the difference in positivity ratios for the winners and losers of each match, essentially telling us whether or not fans of the winning team were more positive than their opponents. As such, matches in which that is the case are colored green while matches that tell the opposite story are colored red.\nThe results are quite telling, as all but four matchups confirm our hypothesis. One bit of context to add to the others is that all four matches in which losing team commenters were more positive were matches decided late. Spain beat Germany in extra time, England beat Slovakia in extra time, the Netherlands overcame a 1-0 deficit in the final 20 minutes to beat Türkiye, and Canada beat Venezuela in penalty kicks. In these cases, comments during the match will come from users entirely unaware of the ending, which explains this uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we consider the hypothesis that positive comments correlate to winning, the below confusion matrix shows the accuracy of that hypothesis. An impotant value to note is the upper-right false negative value. This is greatest for two reasons: as mentioned in EDA there are more commenters from winning sides than losing sides, and that over 62% of comments are marked negative. This data imbalance is what leads to the modal value being off of the main diagonal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next two figures show the performance of sentiment analysis in predicting wins and losses by country. Since it is expected that winning teams will have more positive fans, these are split to either only contain matches in which the commenter’s team won, and those in which they lost. As expected due to the single-elimination format, there are more unique teams that lost than won. Also as expected, the prediction is much better at labeling losing comments as negative than winning comments as positive.\nNonetheless, the plots portray an especially interesting phenomenon with the winning matches, where the bottom three true positive rates come are commenters rooting for England, Spain, and Argentina. These were three of the four finalists in the two tournaments, indicating that sustained success does not necessarily lead to increased positivity. One possible explanation for this is all three teams entered their tournaments with high expectations, making their success less notable for their fans to talk positively about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also looked at player sentiment vs xG differential, as a proxy for determining how player performance differed from performance. This graph highlights the relationship between player positivity (derived from sentiment analysis) and their xG (expected goals) differential, revealing intriguing insights into the alignment between public perception and actual performance. Players like Harry Kane received positive sentiment while also outperforming their xG, reflecting well-aligned perception and exceptional efficiency in front of goal. Conversely, Phil Foden and Lamine Yamal enjoy positive sentiment but underperformed their xG, suggesting a mismatch between their actual contributions and public perception, potentially driven by reputation or other non-performance factors. On the other hand, Nacho, who has neutral xG performance, experiences negative sentiment, perhaps indicating broader dissatisfaction unrelated to scoring output. This makes sense because he is primarily a defender, so he was being judged on factors other than his xG. This visualization effectively juxtaposes sentiment with performance, offering a nuanced understanding of how players are perceived versus how they deliver on the field.\n\nThis bar chart analyzes the sentiment scores of players named to the “Team of the Tournament,” showing the average sentiment score for each player based on public commentary or feedback. Positive sentiment dominates, as reflected by the uniformly green bars, indicating that these players have been widely appreciated for their performances.Lamine Yamal stands out with the highest sentiment score, suggesting that his contributions to the tournament resonated most positively with fans or analysts. Similarly, players like Rodri and Dani Olmo received strong positive sentiment, reflecting widespread recognition of their impactful performances. In contrast, players such as Cucurella and Musiala have relatively lower sentiment scores, which could indicate a less pronounced impact or mixed public perception despite being named to the team. The dashed line labeled “Neutral Sentiment” serves as a benchmark, and it is evident that all players received above-neutral sentiment. This reinforces the idea that being selected to the team of the tournament aligns with receiving positive recognition from the public. The consistent positivity across the board suggests that the selections resonated well with popular opinion, highlighting the quality and influence of these players during the competition.\n\n\n2.5 Conclusion\nUltimately, the main takeaway from this analysis is that sentiment analysis is a capable NLP tool at indicating the success of a team, although with a few caveats. These processes performed worse where matches were decided later on, and there is an imbalance in positive/negative assignment that contradicts the data imbalance where winning commenters are more active. For machine learning, we will add additional information to the data to consider the status of a match at the time of each comment as a way to mitigate these issues. Presumably, a commenter will react positively to good moments in a match, even if their team ultimately loses. Additionally, our data fails to consider reactions outside of the window during and immediately after a match, as well as comments from fans who have not self-identified using Reddit’s user flair. We can also see that overall, the players of the tournament in the Euros were all well received, and that player performance in terms of xG differential did not go hand in hand with the sentiments of these players"

    "text": "2 Analysis Report\n\n2.1 Introduction\nThe primary goal of this project was to bridge the gap between fan sentiment expressed on Reddit and the real-world dynamics of football matches during Euro 2024 and Copa America 2024. By leveraging Spark ML, we aimed to predict match outcomes, identify ongoing match states, and analyze the most recent match events using a combination of sentiment data and structured match statistics.\nThe dataset consisted of three key components:\n\nReddit Comments: Fan sentiment and engagement metrics were derived from subreddit activity related to participating teams in the tournaments, focusing on the knockout stages.\n\nMatch and Player Data: Real-time match events, player statistics, and team performance data provided a robust basis for predictions.\nReddit Submissions: Submissions on the soccer subreddit to get relatively accurate timestamps for goals and match endings in order to determine the context surrounding each comment during a match.\n\nThis approach allowed us to explore the interplay between online sentiment and actual match outcomes, providing a holistic perspective on how fan reactions correlate with team performance. Our initial ML objectives included building and evaluating binary classification models for the following tasks:\n\nHow can machine learning techniques be used to predict match outcomes?\nTo what extent can specific in-game contexts explain simultaneous online behavior?\nIs the predictive ability of machine learning models dependent on the identity of the commenters they seek to analyze?\n\nBy addressing these goals, we sought to advance the field of sports analytics and demonstrate the predictive power of integrated sentiment and event data.\n\n\n2.2 Data Preparation\nSince the binary classification tasks we will be carrying out will use the body of each relevant comment as the input, text preprocessing is a vital step to prepare these strings for analysis. To accomplish this, we used three PySpark preprocessing features. Firstly, Tokenizer was used to break down the text strings into smaller tokens. To isolate only important words that may have an effect on a comment’s meaning, we used StopWordsRemover. Finally, we used HashingTF and IDF to perform TF-IDF vectorization and change the data type such that it can be fed into a machine learning pipeline.\nAdditionally, we considered the target variables, of which there were three. All of them needed to be cast to integers prior to training. The first test was to try to predict the Match Won column, essentially just whether the commenter’s team won the match during which they commented. The second was the Status column, attempting to predict whether the commenter’s team was winning or had won at the time of the comment. Thus, prior to training this model, any comments that occurred while the respective match was tied were removed. Finally, the final test involved the Most Recent Event column, attempting to predict whether the commenter’s team had either most recently scored or already won the match. Similarly, all comments that came before the match’s first goal were removed prior to training.\nThe last step of data preparation was to split the comments dataframe into training and testing sets, which was done randomly using an 80%-20% split.\n\n\n2.3 Model Development\nAfter data preparation, we used the PySpark LogisticRegression model to carry out all three of these binary classification tasks. This assigned probabilities to each record as raw predictions, which were then translated to binary predictions during evaluation using the BinaryClassificationEvaluator in PySpark. It was important to use the same model type and hyperparameters for all three tasks, as we will compare their performances after evaluating. The key metrics that were recorded to determine performance were precision, recall, and F1-score to obtain a thorough understanding of model performances.\n\n\n2.4 Results and Evaluation\nThe following three confusion matrices represent the performances of each of the three models when applied to the testing set of data. One observation that is readily apparent is the data imbalance, which was known from the start. As noted during exploratory data analysis, there is a higher volume of commenters from winning teams. The models clearly picked up on this, and were even more likely to assign a positive value to a comment, presumably reasoning that loss will be diminished when the mode value is selected. Nevertheless, positive values were not entirely selected, and these matrices show that all three tasks performed noticeably better than random selection would. In fact, in all three cases, true negatives outnumber false negatives, despite the exacerbated imbalance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow we can see the comparison of the three models in bar chart and tabular form. This provides a clear picture that machine learning tasks performed better when simply attempting to predict the match winner, rather than either iteration of trying to predict the context of a match at the time of a comment. Once again, all values exceeding 0.5 indicates that the models were able to learn valuable insights that are at least slightly predictive, but introducing more complexity to the data clearly did not help.\nOne potential reason for this is that the time that one commenter sees a match event can differ greatly from when it actually happens or when it is first actualized in an r/soccer submission. Additionally, commenters may comment on the overall state of a match, rather than the immediate happenings at the time. For instance, if a team is outperforming its opponent but neither have scored yet, that team is more likely to win but commenters at the time will not be labelled as commenting during a positive moment in the match.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatch Result\nMatch Status\nMost Recent Event\n\n\n\n\nPrecision\n0.67\n0.60\n0.57\n\n\nRecall\n0.87\n0.62\n0.59\n\n\nF1 score\n0.76\n0.58\n0.55\n\n\n\nFinally, the figure below analyzes where the best model (predicting the overall match result) succeeded and failed. Firstly, these bar charts are split by whether or not the commenter’s team won. As expected due to the single-elimination format, there are far fewer unique winners than losers. This juxtaposition illustrates the point made above, where the data imbalance leads to a scenario where the true positive rate far exceeds true negatives.\nBy comparing performance by country, we can observe one interesting phenomenon. With match losers, the greatest accuracy is found in countries that did relatively well in the tournament, winning multiple games prior to being knocked out late. Each team can only lose once, so while countries can and do differ in quantity of comments, each of these reflects just one match. One possible explanation is that teams with greater expectations who have made it further in the tournament may be more likely to react negatively to a loss, thus making their result more predictable.\n\n\n\n2.5 Conclusion\nThere are two main takeaways from the execution of machine learning techniques. The first is that our methods were relatively effective in using text data to train a Spark ML model and predict team performance. All three tasks performed better than a random selection, which can be considered a success due to the volatility and randomness of Reddit comments. The second is that providing additional context to explain what was happening at the time of a comment had a detrimental effect on model performance.\nUltimately, this exercise shows that real-world sports outcomes are reflected in online discourse, although using just analytical methods may not be sufficient for confidently predicting them. Future tasks might see greater success if comments could be more accurately lined up to in-match events. Additionally, the reality that our dataset relies on self-identification of fandom and a very specific time frame may affect the style of comments, which might not fully reflect an entire corpus of discussion across Reddit."
